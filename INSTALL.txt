Configuration and Installation of skprocrustes for further development
======================================================================

1. Configure a conda environment for the development:

   $ conda create --name envname [pkgs]

   In our case:

   $ conda create --name envname scipy numpy matplotlib ipython

   Activate the new environment:

   $ source activate envname

   To deactivate:

   $ source deactivate

   To list current environments:

   $ conda env list

   More details at https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html [Official Conda Documentation]

2. With the environment activated, install the package by navigating to the root directory of the package and doing

   $ python setup.py install

   (Depending on your installation of conda/miniconda, you might have to prepend the above command with sudo)

3. Import the module and be happy!

   >>> import skprocrustes
